# binary-tree

Example of a binary tree.

## Run

```bash
task run
```

## Advantages

- Simple Structure: Regular binary trees have a straightforward structure with
  each node having at most two children. This simplicity makes them easy to
  understand and implement.
- Natural Representation of Hierarchical Data: Binary trees naturally represent
  hierarchical relationships among data elements. They are suitable for modeling
  hierarchical data structures like family trees, decision trees, and binary search trees.
- Efficient Search in Balanced Trees: In a balanced binary tree (where the
  height is logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes), search operations
  can be performed efficiently with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is
  the number of nodes in the tree.
- Ordered Data in Binary Search Trees: If the binary tree is structured as a
  binary search tree (BST), it maintains elements in sorted order. This property
  facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
- Dynamic Size: Similar to other tree structures, regular binary trees can
  dynamically grow and shrink in size during execution. They can accommodate a
  variable number of elements without the need for pre-allocation of memory.

## Disadvantages

- Unbalanced Trees: Without balancing mechanisms, regular binary trees can
  become unbalanced, leading to degradation in performance. In the worst-case
  scenario, when the tree degenerates into a linear structure, search operations
  may have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Inefficient Search in Unbalanced Trees: In an unbalanced binary tree, search
  operations may have a time complexity proportional to the height of the tree,
  which can be as high as O(n) for skewed trees.
- Limited Operations: Regular binary trees support a limited set of operations
  compared to more complex data structures like hash tables or graphs. While
  they excel in hierarchical representation and some searching operations, they
  may not be suitable for applications requiring advanced operations like
  constant-time lookup or graph traversal.
- Memory Overhead: Each node in a binary tree requires additional memory for
  storing pointers to its left and right children, leading to higher memory
  overhead compared to linear data structures like arrays or linked lists.
- No Ordered Data in Non-Binary Search Trees: In regular binary trees that are
  not structured as binary search trees (BSTs), there is no guarantee of ordered
  data. This can limit their utility in applications where sorted data is
  required.
